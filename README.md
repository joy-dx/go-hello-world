# Hello World (Go)

An incredibly simple Hello World API service built on top of Gin to be used for experimentation purposes for a tool I am building.

## Quickstart

This is a standard Go program launched from `main.go`

```
go run main.go
```

## Notes

* There is a purposeful fake secret leaked within main.go for the sake of checking Trufflehog works correctly
